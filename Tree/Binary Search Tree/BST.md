# Intro
A Binary Search Tree is a special form of a binary tree. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values in its left subtree but less than (or equal to) any values in its right subtree.


# Properties
- The value in each node must be ==greater than (or equal to)== any values in its left subtree but 
- The value in each node must be ==less than (or equal to)== any values in its right subtree.
- The inorder traversal is the most frequent used traversal method of a BST. It is noteworthy that ==inorder traversal== in BST will be in ==ascending order.==
